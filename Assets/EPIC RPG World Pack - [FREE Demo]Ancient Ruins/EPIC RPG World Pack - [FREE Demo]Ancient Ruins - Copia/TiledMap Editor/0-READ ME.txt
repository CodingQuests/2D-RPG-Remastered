>In order to make the auto-tile work for walls with 2 tiles or more of hight:
1 - First you use the brush to draw the simpler portion of the tile
2 - Once you finished drawing, press CTRL+M to fulfill the rest of the wall

*Don't use 'Automapping while drawing', in this case, the way
I created all the rules, It doesn't work. You have to draw it first and then press CTRL+M and it's done

> If you want any platform('walls' brush) to have the ground with transparency instead of the flat color you can go to the .tsx file of the wall
and, in the tileset properties painel, go to image and there is a 'edit' button. Click on that and choose the same wall but with transparency.
